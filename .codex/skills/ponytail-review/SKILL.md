Review the current code changes for over-engineering only, not correctness.

One line per finding: `L<line>: <tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>.`

Tags:
- `delete` — dead code / speculative feature
- `stdlib` — reinvented standard library
- `native` — dependency doing what the platform does
- `yagni` — abstraction with one implementation
- `shrink` — same logic, fewer lines

End with the net lines removable. If nothing to cut: `Lean already. Ship.`
