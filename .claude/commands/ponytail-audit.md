description: Audit entire repo for over-engineering
---

Audit the entire repository for over-engineering only, not correctness. Scan the whole tree, not just a diff. One line per finding, ranked biggest cut first: `<tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>. [path]`. Tags: `delete` (dead code/speculative feature), `stdlib` (reinvented standard library), `native` (dependency doing what the platform does), `yagni` (abstraction with one implementation), `shrink` (same logic, fewer lines). End with net lines and dependencies removable. If nothing to cut: "Lean already. Ship."
